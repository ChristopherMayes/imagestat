ImageStat is a small utility to calculate second order central image moments using scanning mask technique

The method was originally developed in F. Lohl's paper
Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams, 9, p. 092802, (2006)
and further enchanced in Y. Sun's PhD Dissertation 
“Angular-momentum-dominated electron beams and
flat-beam generation”, University of
Chicago, Chicago, USA (2005)

ImageStat uses a three-parametric elliptical mask for scanning. Presented version is written in python2.7 and for academic use only.

Usage:

python image.py

Adjust parameters in parameters.py
